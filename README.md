Example project that contains both JUnit and Spock tests with Spring Boot Application. Created to learn how JUnit runner (and Spring Context Test) handles that.

Note, there are two branches: master (spock 2.0 with groovy 3.7) and groovy-2.5 (spock 2.0 and groovy 2.5) to see if there is any difference
